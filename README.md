# ⚖️ Andha Kanoon

### *Your Indian Legal Assistant* 🇮🇳


## 📌 Overview

**Andha Kanoon** is an educational AI-based legal assistant designed to analyze hypothetical criminal cases under the **Indian legal framework**.
The project combines **rule-based Machine Learning** with **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to explain legal provisions, procedures, and consequences in **simple and beginner-friendly language**.

This system is built for **legal awareness, academic demonstration, and ethical AI learning**, not as a replacement for professional legal advice.


## 🎯 Key Objectives

* To demonstrate the use of **AI and ML in the legal domain**
* To simplify understanding of **Indian Penal Code (IPC)**, **Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)**, and **Indian Evidence Act**
* To build a **responsible, explainable, and ethical AI system**
* To provide a **guided legal analysis flow** for students and learners


## 🧠 How the System Works

### 1️⃣ Case Input

* User enters a **case story**
* Selects **case type** and **truth percentage**
* Optionally uploads **evidence** and additional statements

### 2️⃣ Machine Learning Severity Scoring

* A **rule-based ML model** assigns a **severity score (0–100)**
* The score reflects the seriousness of the case based on keywords, truth level, and case type

### 3️⃣ AI Legal Analysis

* A **Groq-powered LLM** analyzes the case
* Explains:

  * Nature of the offence
  * Applicable IPC sections
  * Legal procedure under CrPC
  * Role of evidence

### 4️⃣ Lawyer-Style Verdict Flow

* User selects **Guilty** or **Not Guilty**
* The system responds like a **legal counsel**, explaining:

  * Legal consequences and punishment (if guilty)
  * Rights, defence, and trial procedure (if not guilty)

### 5️⃣ Memory System

* Previously analyzed cases are stored in-session
* Helps demonstrate learning, comparison, and system continuity


## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Backend Logic:** Python
* **AI Model:** Groq LLM (LLaMA family)
* **Machine Learning:** Rule-based severity scoring
* **Environment Management:** Python dotenv
* **Ethics:** Safety prompts and legal disclaimers

---

## 🛡️ Ethical Considerations

* The system **does not promote or instruct illegal activities**
* All cases are treated as **educational and hypothetical**
* Legal outputs are **advisory opinions**, not court judgments
* Includes **input validation** and **content-safety prompts**


## 🚀 Features

* AI-based legal explanation in plain language
* Severity-based legal assessment
* Lawyer-style advisory verdict
* Input validation for meaningful cases
* Case memory for demonstration
* Clean and stable UI
